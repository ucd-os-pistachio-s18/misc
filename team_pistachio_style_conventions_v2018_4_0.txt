/* Indentation follows typical paragraph type style to make code easier to read.  

Tabs are sufficient for white space when an inner block is created, however tabs 
should be implemented as series of spaces due to the inconsisencies of rendering 
\t characters between different software and other systems.  

Single space returns are sufficient between 'paragraphs', and double space 
returns are ideal between functions or other major blocks of code.
